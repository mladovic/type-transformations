# Uppercase Object Keys with Template Literals

In TypeScript, **template literal types** can be combined with utility types like `Uppercase`, `Lowercase`, `Capitalize` and `Uncapitalize` to transform string literals. This can be useful when you want to programmatically manipulate object keys, enforcing consistent formats.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll be working with an event system where players interact with different activities like exploring dungeons, battling monsters, and trading with merchants. The events are initially named in lowercase (e.g., explore_dungeon, battle_monster, trade_goods), but your task is to create an object where the keys are the uppercase versions of these event names.

## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment

Your task is to use template literal types combined with the `Uppercase` utility type to generate an object where the keys are the uppercase versions of the event names. The values for each key should be of type string.

- Use the `Uppercase` utility type to transform the event names into uppercase versions.
- Use the `Record` utility type to create an object where the keys are the uppercase event names and the values are string.
- Ensure that your solution passes the provided tests.
